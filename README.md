A Valgrind tool that watches arithmetic operations and signals suspecious events (integer overflow, cancellation, smearing, underflow, NaN result...).

Look at the [User Guide](https://github.com/Cojac/cojac-grind/wiki/Cojacgrind-User-Guide) for a more detailed description.

We have also realized a similar tool for Java: [COJAC](https://github.com/Cojac/Cojac).

Our [article](http://drdobbs.com/testing/232601564#) in Dr Dobb's can be considered as the "white paper" of this project.

Developed at the [School of Engineering of Fribourg](https://www.heia-fr.ch),
