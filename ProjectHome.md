A Valgrind tool that watches arithmetic operations and signals suspecious events (integer overflow, cancellation, smearing, underflow, NaN result...).

Look at the [User Guide](http://code.google.com/p/cojac-grind/wiki/CojacgrindGuide) for a more detailed description.

We have also realized a similar tool for Java: [COJAC](https://code.google.com/p/cojac), with an [Eclipse plugin](https://code.google.com/p/cojac/wiki/EclipsePlugin).

Our [article](http://drdobbs.com/testing/232601564#) in Dr Dobb's can be considered as the "white paper" of this project.
